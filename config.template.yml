# Access Control
#
# Access control is a set of rules you can use to restrict the user access.
# Default (anyone), per-user or per-group rules can be defined.
#
# If 'access_control' is not defined, ACL rules are disabled and default policy
# is applied, i.e., access is allowed to anyone. Otherwise restrictions follow 
# the rules defined below.
# If no rule is provided, all domains are denied.
#
# '*' means 'any' subdomains and matches any string. It must stand at the 
# beginning of the pattern.

  default:
    - public.test.local
